# SLUM
* Brief
  * Spectral Library of Impervious Urban Materials
* Manual
  * [Manual](other files/LUMA_SLUM.pdf)
    * contains photos, meta information for all 74 samples and plots of the short-wave reflactance (300-2500 nm) and long-wave (8-14 um) emissivity spectra
* Background
  * The radiative response of impervious urban materials is a highly influential surface property, due to its impacts on the radiation balance of incoming and outgoing long- and short-wave fluxes. Information about the material composition can be determined with data resolved to the wavelength level. Spectral reflectance in the visible- to short-wave infrared (VIS-SWIR) region is widely used in remote sensing-based land cover classification and spectral long-wave infrared (LWIR) emissivity is required for the observation of surface temperatures. The Spectral Library of impervious Urban Materials (SLUM) available from the London Urban Micromet data Archive (LUMA) includes LWIR emissivity spectra of 74 samples of impervious surfaces derived using measurements made by a portable Fourier Transform InfraRed (FTIR) spectrometer and matching short-wave reflectance spectra observed for each urban sample.
